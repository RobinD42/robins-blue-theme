# README

I like it when editors have a very distinct separation between the editor panel
and the "chrome" around the edges, like the explorer bar, tabs, etc. Since I
couldn't find any existing VSCode themes that I liked that did this (most tend
to use similar colors for all parts of the window) I decided to make my own. The
result is this theme, "Robin's Blue Theme".

Enjoy!
